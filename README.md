# A Colorful Calculator
Made as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. I wanted to try and make using a calculator more interesting so I created a simple calculator with colorful feedback. Animations powered by Paper.js.

## Features
* Responsive UI and JS - still tweaking mobile animation limits
* Randomly set animation colors for user input on load
* Random animation colors for answers
* Calculator history with the ability to return to or use the solution of a previous expression on click
